# Variables in Python 

1. Variables are basically **Fundamental Elements in programming** used to store data that can be **referenced and manipulated** in a program. In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them, and they do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to the variable


## Naming Convention - how should we name a variable
1. Variable names should be **descriptive**
2. They must start with a letter or '_' and they must **only contain letters,numbers and underscores**
3. Variable names are **Case Sensitive**

## Python is Dynamically Typed - The type of the variable is determined at Rutime
1. if you write age = 25, when you execute it during the runtime Python will understand "Hey fine so integer is getting assigned so age will be of type Integer"
